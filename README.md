# Data science crash course

**Who is this repository for?**

This repository is for people with a strong academic background who are considering a high-impact career in data science. Many of the skills required to be a successful data scientist can be acquired through research but without special attention, many gaps will remain. 

**What is meant by *strong academic background*?**

A strong academic background is shorthand for someone confident with technical aspects of mathematics and computer science through university education or research experience. Our focus will be less on the theoretical aspect of data science and more on practical skills valuable to data scientists.
